# Loan Eligibility Prediction System

This project is a **Loan Eligibility Prediction System** designed to predict whether loan applicants are eligible for a loan based on various features such as income, education, loan amount, and other relevant factors. The system uses **machine learning algorithms** to automate the decision-making process for financial institutions, improving the efficiency and accuracy of loan approval procedures.

## Introduction

The **Loan Eligibility Prediction System** predicts whether an applicant qualifies for a loan using historical loan data. By training machine learning models on past loan approvals, the system can make accurate predictions on new applications. This can help financial institutions streamline the loan approval process, reduce human error, and provide a consistent evaluation of applicants.

## Features

- **Data Preprocessing**: Cleans and preprocesses data, handling missing values and encoding categorical variables.
- **Feature Selection**: Identifies and selects key features impacting loan eligibility.
- **Model Training**: Implements multiple machine learning models such as **Logistic Regression**, **Decision Trees**, and **Random Forests**.
- **Model Evaluation**: Evaluates models using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
- **GUI**: (Optional) A user-friendly interface using **Tkinter** for easy interaction and testing.

## Technologies Used

- **Python**: The core programming language.
- **Pandas** and **NumPy**: For data manipulation and preprocessing.
- **Scikit-learn**: For implementing machine learning algorithms.
- **Matplotlib** and **Seaborn**: For data visualization.
- **Tkinter**: For the graphical user interface (optional).
- **Jupyter Notebook**: For step-by-step analysis and model development.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
  https://github.com/Jayanth-007/Loan_Analysis_For_Eligibilty/new/main?filename=README.md#introduction
   ```

2. Install the required dependencies:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage

1. To run the system, you can execute the **Jupyter notebook** for step-by-step execution or run the Python scripts directly.
   
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook Loan_Eligibility_Prediction.ipynb
   ```

2. If using the optional GUI:

   ```bash
   python loan_gui.py
   ```

3. Input loan application details via the GUI or in the notebook, and the system will predict loan eligibility.

## Dataset

The dataset consists of various features such as:

- **ApplicantIncome**: The applicant's income.
- **CoapplicantIncome**: The co-applicant's income (if any).
- **LoanAmount**: The loan amount requested.
- **Loan_Amount_Term**: The term of the loan.
- **Credit_History**: Credit history of the applicant.
- **Property_Area**: Rural, Urban, or Semi-Urban.
- **Dependents**, **Education**, **Marital Status**, etc.

You can use publicly available datasets like the [Loan Prediction Dataset on Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/altruistdelhite04/loan-prediction-problem-dataset) or your custom dataset for training and testing.

## Model Evaluation

The project evaluates different machine learning models on various metrics:

- **Accuracy**: Percentage of correct predictions.
- **Precision**: Correct positive predictions out of all positive predictions.
- **Recall**: True positive rate.
- **F1-Score**: Harmonic mean of precision and recall.

After testing various models, the one with the best performance is chosen for final deployment.
